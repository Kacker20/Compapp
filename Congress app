<h2>History</h2>
     
<p>In the House, every state is represented according to its population, with larder states getting more representatives than smaller ones. In total, there are 435 representatives. In contrast, in the Senate, each states, regardless of its population, gets 2 representatives, so there are 100 of them in total.</p>

     <p>When it comes to debate procedures, since the Senateis smaller, they are less formal there than in the House. In addition, the term-lengths in the House are shorter: two years, in contrast with six years in the Senate. That is why the representatives of the House tend to be more sensitive to the issues that concern the constituents than the senators. One other interesting difference is that in the House, the debates usually can not go for longer than an hour, while in the Senate, they are unlimited.</p>
     
<p>The House and the Senate also have very different powers. For example, all revenue bills originate in the House because, as mentioned above, the representatives are more responsive to the needs of the residents than senators. However, it is the Senate that is responsible for impeachment trials. This happens because this way, each state has equal power over deciding what will happen with the president.</p>
